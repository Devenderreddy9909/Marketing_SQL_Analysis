# Marketing_SQL_Analysis
The 'Sustainable Clothing Co.' have been running several marketing campaigns and have asked you to provide your insight into whether they have been successful or not. 
Analyze the following data and answer the questions to form your answer.
I would like to express my gratitude to Matthew Steel and Steel Data for providing an SQL challenging Case Study #6.

During in this analysis I exposed on various SQL functions
· Joins
· Where clause
· Aggregate functions
· Group by clause
· Order by clause
· Limit in SQL
· CTEs
. Subquery etc..

Findings:

1.Summer Sale campaign has achieved more sales compare to other campaign, and generated revenue of 1045 among all 3 campaign.
2.Top of the product has Organic Cotton Sweater among all 20 products and category wise Bottom category products has generated more revenue.
3.Recycled Denim Jeans has the more revenue contribution share 13.7% compared to all products.
4.Although the average number of quantities sold has higher during campaigns, the total revenue generated outside the campaign exceeded the total revenue during the campaign.
